This thesis work would not be possible without the support of many people. I would like to thank my supervisors for their support and help in the development of this thesis.\bigskip

Thanks to my partner, Heidi G., for constantly listening to me rant and talk about strange things over and over, and for the sacrifices you have made and shared with me in order to help me pursue this Master's Degree. I also want to express my deep appreciation for Carol who taught me the importance of wit, sound sleep, and playfulness and for her cuddly, fidelity and love.\bigskip

Thanks to my parents, my father Gioacchino L., my mother Maria Carmela G. and my sister Carlotta L., for your endless support, both economically as well as for believing in me with regular encouragement in every step to continue in my path.\bigskip

I also would like to thank all my respected teachers and colleagues in the Control and Computer Engineering department. \bigskip

Without all of you, I could have never reached this point in my life.
