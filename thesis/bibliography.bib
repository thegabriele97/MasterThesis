abstract = {FPGA-based designs are more susceptible to single-event upsets (SEUs) compared to ASIC designs. Soft error rate (SER) estimation is a crucial step in the design of soft error tolerant schemes to balance reliability, performance, and cost of the system. Previous techniques on FPGA SER estimation are based on time-consuming fault injection and simulation methods.In this paper, we present an analytical approach to estimate the failure rate of designs mapped into FPGAs. Experimental results show that this technique is orders of magnitude faster than fault injection method while is very accurate. We also present a high-reliable low-cost mitigation technique which can significantly improve the availability of FPGA-based designs. This technique is able to tolerate SEUs in both user and configuration bits of mapped designs.},

  abstract = "Communication systems that work in jeopardized environments such
              as space are affected by soft errors that can cause malfunctions
              in the behavior of the circuits such as, for example, single
              event upsets (SEUs) or multiple bit upsets (MBUs). In order to
              avoid this erroneous functioning, this kind of systems are
              usually protected using redundant logic such as triple modular
              redundancy (TMR) or error correction codes (ECCs). After the
              implementation of the protected modules, the communication
              modules must be tested to assess the achieved reliability. These
              tests could be driven into accelerator facilities through
              ionization processes or they can be performed using fault
              injection tools based on software simulation such as the SEUs
              simulation tool (SST), or based on field-programmable gate array
              (FPGA) emulation like the one described in this work. In this
              paper, a tutorial for the setup of a fault injection emulation
              platform based on the Xilinx soft error mitigation (SEM)
              intellectual property (IP) controller is depicted step by step,
              showing a complete cycle. To illustrate this procedure, an online
              repository with a complete project and a step-by-step guide is
              provided, using as device under test a classical communication
              component such as a finite impulse response (FIR) filter.
              Finally, the integration of the automatic configuration memory
              error-injection (ACME) tool to speed up the fault injection
              process is explained in detail at the end of the paper.",

% % An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
% % settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
% % before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
% % (just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
% % in the bibliography.)
% % The available control fields are:
% %
% % CTLuse_article_number
% % "no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
% % "yes" enables
% %
% % CTLuse_paper
% % "no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
% % "yes" enables
% %
% % CTLuse_forced_etal
% % "no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
% % "yes" enables
% %
% % CTLmax_names_forced_etal
% % The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
% % usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames_show_etal (below)
% % is not greater than this value!
% %
% % CTLnames_show_etal
% % The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
% % Must be less than or equal to CTLmax_names_forced_etal
% %
% % CTLuse_alt_spacing
% % "no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
% % "yes" enables
% %
% % CTLalt_stretch_factor
% % If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
% % the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
% % default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
% % stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.
% %
% % CTLdash_repeated_names
% % "no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
% % of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
% % "yes" enables
% %
% % CTLname_format_string
% % The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
% % guide.
% % IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,
% %
% % CTL_name_latex_cmd
% % A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
% % Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
% % The default is empty.
% %
% % Those fields that are not to be changed can be left out or empty.
